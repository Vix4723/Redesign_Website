# Redesigning the Website: Dogster.com

This website was created for the MLH Local Hack Day: Build 2021 Hackathon. I did not have as much time as I wanted but here is what I got, but I hope you like it.

The objective of the daily challenge is to redesign one of my favorites websites. Here is the prompt of the Daily Challenge: Ever been frustrated with how a website was laid out? We want you to pick any website and imagine a new layout for it. You can simply draw it out, wireframe it, or even write the HTML/CSS if you'd like.
